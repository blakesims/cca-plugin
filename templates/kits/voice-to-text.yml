# Progressive customisation: each level includes all questions from levels below it.
# The PRD skill asks "How deep do you want to configure?" first, then asks
# only the questions for that level + all lower levels.
# Keys not asked get their value from `defaults`.

  # {{app_name}} — Voice-to-Text Transcriber

  ## Problem Statement
  I need a local voice-to-text tool for {{use_case}}. It should run entirely on my machine
  with no cloud APIs, keeping my audio private.

  ## Must Have (v1)
  1. Record audio from microphone (16kHz, mono)
  2. Transcribe speech to text using local AI model ({{model}})
  3. Display transcription {{#ui_terminal}}in the terminal{{/ui_terminal}}{{#ui_web}}in a browser UI{{/ui_web}}{{#ui_desktop}}in a floating always-on-top window{{/ui_desktop}}
  4. {{#output_clipboard}}Auto-copy transcribed text to clipboard{{/output_clipboard}}{{#output_file}}Save transcriptions to a text file{{/output_file}}{{#output_print}}Print transcribed text to screen{{/output_print}}
  {{#autopaste}}5. Auto-paste transcribed text into the active window after transcription{{/autopaste}}
  5. Work offline — no internet required after initial model download
  6. Config file (`config.yaml`) to change model, language, and output without editing code

  ## Technical Approach

  **Stack:**
  - Python 3.10+
  - `faster-whisper` — local Whisper model inference (pip install, no compilation needed)
  - `sounddevice` — microphone capture (ships its own PortAudio drivers, no system deps)
  - `numpy` — audio buffer handling
  - `scipy` — WAV file writing
  {{#ui_web}}- `flask` — lightweight web server for browser UI{{/ui_web}}
  {{#ui_desktop}}- `PySide6` — floating always-on-top window (Qt framework, professional look){{/ui_desktop}}
  {{#output_clipboard}}- `pyperclip` — cross-platform clipboard access{{/output_clipboard}}
  {{#hotkey}}- `pynput` — global keyboard shortcut listener{{/hotkey}}
  {{#autopaste}}- `pynput` — simulate Cmd+V / Ctrl+V to auto-paste{{/autopaste}}

  **Architecture:**
  ```
  Microphone → sounddevice (capture) → numpy buffer → WAV temp file → faster-whisper ({{model}}) → text → output
  ```

  **Recording flow:**
  {{^streaming}}1. User triggers recording (button, Enter key, or hotkey)
  2. Audio streams into a buffer via sounddevice callback
  3. User stops recording
  4. Buffer saved to temp WAV file
  5. faster-whisper transcribes the file
  6. Text displayed / copied / pasted{{/streaming}}
  {{#streaming}}1. Audio streams continuously via sounddevice callback
  2. Chunks sent to faster-whisper in real-time
  3. Partial transcriptions displayed as they arrive
  4. Final text assembled when user stops{{/streaming}}

  {{#ui_desktop}}
  **Floating window states:**
  - IDLE: Small indicator (pill/dot) — ready to record
  - RECORDING: Expanded — shows recording in progress
  - TRANSCRIBING: Shows spinner/progress
  - DONE: Shows transcribed text briefly, then returns to IDLE

  **Window flags:** Always on top, frameless, does not steal focus from active window.
  {{/ui_desktop}}

  **Model:** `{{model}}` from faster-whisper (auto-downloads on first run)
  {{#language_en}}English-only model — faster and more accurate for English speech.{{/language_en}}
  {{#language_multi}}Multilingual model with automatic language detection.{{/language_multi}}

  ## Configuration
  `config.yaml` at project root:
  ```yaml
  model: {{model}}
  language: {{language}}
  output: {{output}}
  {{#hotkey}}hotkey: ctrl+shift+r{{/hotkey}}
  ```
  Users can change these without editing Python code.

  ## Platform Notes
  - Works on macOS and Linux out of the box
  - **Windows users: use native Python, NOT WSL** — WSL has no reliable microphone access
  - macOS: terminal/IDE will prompt for microphone permission on first run — just click Allow
  - First run downloads the model (~75MB for base.en) — needs internet once
  {{#hotkey}}- macOS: global hotkeys require Accessibility permission in System Settings{{/hotkey}}

  ## Success Criteria
  - Record a 10-second clip and see accurate transcription
  - Model loads in under 5 seconds on modern hardware
  - Transcription completes in under 2 seconds for a 10-second clip
  - Works without internet after first model download
  {{#ui_desktop}}- Floating window stays on top of other apps without stealing focus{{/ui_desktop}}
  {{#output_clipboard}}- Transcribed text appears in clipboard ready to paste{{/output_clipboard}}

  ## Out of Scope
  - Speaker diarization (who said what)
  - Real-time translation
  - Cloud API fallback
  - Mobile support
  - Post-processing / grammar cleanup (future enhancement)

  ## Install
  ```bash
  pip install faster-whisper sounddevice numpy scipy{{#output_clipboard}} pyperclip{{/output_clipboard}}{{#ui_web}} flask{{/ui_web}}{{#ui_desktop}} PySide6{{/ui_desktop}}{{#hotkey}} pynput{{/hotkey}}{{#autopaste}} pynput{{/autopaste}}
  ```
