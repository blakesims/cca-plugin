  ## Problem Statement
  {{niche}} need a landing page to capture emails for "{{lead_magnet_title}}".

  ## Must Have (v1)
  1. Single HTML page with email capture form
  2. Form submits to a thank-you message (no backend — just client-side swap)
  3. Mobile responsive
  4. Clean, minimal design

  ## Technical Approach
  - Single index.html file (no framework, no build step)
  - CSS in a <style> tag
  - JavaScript: form submit swaps the form for a "Thanks! Check your email" message
  - No backend, no database, no email integration (just the UI)

  ## Success Criteria
  - Page loads from file:// or any static server
  - Form shows validation (email required)
  - Submit swaps to thank-you message
  - Looks good on mobile

  ## Out of Scope
  - Actual email sending
  - Backend / API
  - Analytics
